### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹, I am Mehdi,
----
I am an AI research scientist | Full-stack AI/Software engineer. I help companies and startups operationalize (build and deploy) LLM applications.

- I work on Generative AI (LLMs), Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Speech Recognition, and end-to-end machine learning system design.
- I build AI products, and help companies operationalize LLMs including prototyping, building and deploying AI apps into production.  
- I like data visualization and creating interactive data viz, dashboards and custom visualizations.
- I have a newsletter <a href="https://mlnotes.substack.com/">MLnotes</a> that provide bite-size content about Careers in Machine Learning and AI, interviews tips, and industry use cases or applications for AI.
- I have <a href="https://mallahyari.github.io/visualdecode/">Visdecode</a> website that write blogs covering a wide range of topics related to data visualization, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. I also explore how machine learning can be applied to data visualization, and share practical examples of how to use machine learning algorithms to gain insights from data.
